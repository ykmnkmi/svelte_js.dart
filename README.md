Testing Svelte 5 JS bindings and ~~compiler~~ with new Dart JS & WASM
interopability.

Hard to implement:
- Prop spreading for HTML elements.

Currently, all Dart code in the examples is not yet generated by the compiler.

To rebuild Svelte 5 JS bundle, run `npm run build`.

Download Dart SDK from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart) which supports
`ExternalDartReference` and extract it to `.sdk` folder. If you have Dart SDK
installed, delete SDK path in `.vscode/settings.json` file.

To rebuild WASM module, run the following command
`dart compile wasm --no-name-section .\web\main.dart`.
